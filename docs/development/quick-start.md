# Quick Start Guide

This page explains how to get tremor running on a local system for development or testing. There are 2 ways of installing tremor:

1) Installing tremor on the system without docker
2) Using docker

## Without Docker

### Install Rust

Tremor can be run on any platform without using docker by installing the rust ecosystem. To install the rust ecosystem, you can use [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) which is a toolchain installer.

Rustup will install all the necessary tools required for rust, which includes `rustc` (the compiler) and cargo (package manager).

Tremor is built using the latest stable toolchain, so when asked to select the toolchain during installation, select stable.

#### macOS/Linux

Run the following command and follow the on-screen instructions:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Now activate it by adding `source $HOME/.cargo/env` to your `.rc file` and open a new console.

For building tremor on macOS, you also need to install xcode and the commandline tools.

### Windows

Pre-requisite: Rust requires the Microsoft C++ build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later. You can get those from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019. During installation, make sure Windows 10 SDK is selected (should be on by default).

Now download the rustup installer by clicking [here](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64), run it and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Additional Libraries

#### macOS

```bash
brew install openssl
brew install autoconf
brew install re2c
brew install bison #make sure to follow the printed instructions!
```

#### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake
```

#### Windows

* [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/): choose the latest stable release (3.16 at the time of writing)
* [clang](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html): choose windows pre-built binaries for the latest release that has it (9.0.0 at the time of writing)

Make sure the cmake and llvm binaries are added to the system path for at least the current user (if not all), as part of the installation process.

Since openssl does not provided official builds, you can get it via [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

First, set up vcpkg:
```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg integrate install # hook up user-wide integration
```

Now install openssl with:
```
.\vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows-static
```

To pick up the openssl libs during tremor build, you also have to set the `OPENSSL_DIR` environment variable right now. Example:
```
set OPENSSL_DIR=C:\Users\juju\TREMOR\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows-static
```

Technically, the rust [openssl](https://docs.rs/openssl) crate will try to discover the openssl libs via vcpkg (as long as env var `VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC` is set), but that is not working for the recent openssl libs supplied by vcpkg. There's a [fix](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/pull/1238) for it and once that lands in a release for `rust-openssl` (and also starts getting used by tremor depenencies), we won't have to rely on the `OPENSSL_DIR` var.

### Running Tremor

After installing rust and cloning the repository, you can start tremor server by changing to `tremor-server` directory in tremor and running:

```bash
cargo run
```

To run the test suite, in the root (`tremor-runtime`) directory you can run:

```bash
cargo test
```

This will run all the tests in the suite, except those which are feature-gated and not needed to quickly test tremor.

#### Rustfmt

`Rustfmt` is a tool for formatting rust code according to style guidelines. It maintains consistency in the style in the entire project.

To install `rustfmt` run:

```bash
rustup component add rustfmt
```

To run `rustfmt` on the project, run the following command:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

#### Clippy

`Clippy` is a linting tool that catches common mistakes and improves the rust code. It is available as a toolchain component and can be installed by running:

```bash
rustup component add clippy
```

To run `clippy`, run the following comand:

```bash
cargo clippy
```

#### Rustfix

`Rustfix` automatically applies suggestions made by rustc. There are two ways of using `rustfix` - either by adding it as a library to `Cargo.toml` or by installing it as a cargo subcommand by running:

```bash
cargo install cargo-fix
```

To run it, you can run:

```bash
cargo fix
```

#### Tree

`Cargo tree` is a subcommand that visualizes a crate's dependency-graph and display a tree structure of them. To install it:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tree
```

To run it:

```bash
cargo tree
```

#### Flamegraph

`Flamegraph` is a profiling tool that visualises where time is spent in a program. It generates a SVG image based on the current location of the code and the function that were called to get there.

To install it:

```bash
cargo install cargo-flamegraph
```

To run it:

```bash
cargo flamegraph
```

### Integration Tests

Tremor contains integration tests that tests it from a user's perspective. To run the integration tests you can run:

```bash
make it
```

## With Docker

Tremor contains a `Dockerfile` which makes it easier to run and build using docker. It also contains a makefile so that common docker commands.

Make sure docker has at least 4GB of memory.

To build tremor you can run:

```bash
make image
```

To run the images:

```bash
make demo
```
