# The `stats` namespace

The `stats` module contains functions for aggregating statistical measures
of various events.


## Size

When using stats aggregate functions size in memory becomes an important factor from a capacity
planning perspective. The exact size of a window using aggregates depends on three main factors:

* The size of the dimension identifier. I.e. if the window is identified by the string "window" it will
  require that amount of memory related to this. If it is identified by an array of 10.000 elements
  all reading "window" it will use (about) 10.000 times that size.
* The unit size of each aggregate used in the window. We will try to give an estimate of size
  for each aggregate but please be aware that those are not always exact as they can depend on
  the data they hold.
* The number of groups, if grouping is configured. Each group will maintain a separate window of data

For aggregates we'll provide an "order of magnitude" and a growth rate if applicable.

For example `Fixed, 10 bytes` indicate that the size doesn't grow and is in the order of two digit
bytes. We try to give pessimistic estimates where possible.


## Functions

### stats::count() -> int

* **size**: Fixed, 10 bytes

Counts the number of events aggregated in the current windowed operation.

```trickle
stats::count() # number of items in the window
```

### stats::min(int|float) -> int|float

* **size**: Fixed, 10 bytes

Determines the smallest event value in the current windowed operation.

```trickle
stats::min(event.value)
```

### stats::max(int|float) -> int|float

* **size**: Fixed, 10 bytes


Determines the largest event value in the current windowed operation.

```trickle
stats::max(event.value)
```

### stats::sum(int|float) -> int|float

* **size**: Fixed, 10 bytes

Determines the arithmetic sum of event values in the current windowed operation.

```trickle
stats::sum(event.value)
```

### stats::var(int|float) -> float

* **size**: Fixed, 100 bytes

Calculates the sample variance of event values in the current windowed operation.

```trickle
stats::var(event.value)
```

### stats::stdev(int|float) -> float

* **size**: Fixed, 100 bytes

Calculates the sample standard deviation of event values in the current windowed operation.

```trickle
stats::stdev(event.value)
```

### stats::mean(int|float) -> float

* **size**: Fixed, 100 bytes

Calculates the stastical mean of the event values in the current windowed operation.

```trickle
stats::mean(event.value)
```

### stats::hdr(int|float) -> record

* **size**: Fixed, 100 Kilo Bytes (note: this strongly depends on configuration, and can be estimated more correctly [with this formula](https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram#footprint-estimation))

Uses a High Dynamic Range ( HDR ) Histogram to calculate all basic statistics against the event values sin the current windowed operation. The function additionally interpolates percentiles or quartiles based on a configuration specification passed in as an argument to the aggregater function.

The HDR Histogram trades off memory utilisation for accuracy and is configured internally to limit accuracy to 2 significant decimal places.

```trickle
stats::hdr(event.value, ["0.5","0.75","0.9","0.99","0.999"])
```

### stats::dds(int|float) -> record

* **size**: Fixed, 10 Kilo Bytes (estimate based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10693.pdf))

Uses a Distributed data-stream Sketch ( [DDS (paper)](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p2195-masson.pdf) Histogram to calculate count, min, max, mean and quartiles with quartile relative-error accurate over the range of points in the histogram. The DDS histogram trades off accuracy ( to a very low error and guaranteed low relative error ) and unlike HDR histograms does not need bounds specified.

```trickle
stats::dds(event.value, ["0.5","0.75","0.9","0.99","0.999"])
```
